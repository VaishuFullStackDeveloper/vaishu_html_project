            Rohit Sharma (born April 30, 1987, Bansod, India) is an Indian international cricketer and the current
            captain of the Indian cricket team in the Test and One-Day International (ODI) formats. Sharma was also the
            captain of India’s Twenty20 International team until he announced his retirement on June 29, 2024, after
            leading the Indian side to its T20I World Cup victory. He captained the Mumbai Indians, a franchise team in
            the Indian Premier League (IPL), for 10 years and led them to five titles. Sharma is known for his batting
            prowess and is nicknamed “Hitman” by his fans. He is also an occasional off-spinner.

            Sharma is the only player to have scored three double hundreds in ODI cricket; no other player has scored
            even two. He also holds the record for most international sixes across all formats, most sixes in World
            Cups, and the highest individual score in an ODI. He was a member of the Indian sides that won the 2007 T20I
            World Cup, the 2013 ICC (International Cricket Council) Champions Trophy, and the 2024 T20I World Cup.
